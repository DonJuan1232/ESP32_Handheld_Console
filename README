This project is for a self designed handheld console.
The idea is that I create a base framework so that other developers can easily create games for this "platform"

Because I wanted to learn how to design a PCB I decided to design a PCB (Also because I really didnt want to solder a lot of buttons to a prototype board :) )
Later in the projects life cycle I will add all the PCB and 3d model design files.
